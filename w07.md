# Top 10 List of Week 07

### 1. [Introduction of Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)
Based on this site, process are categorized into two types, independent and cooperative process. Problem in process occurred in cooperative process because it share resources. This site also explains Race Condition and Critical Section Problem very briefly. Pretty good explanations from this site.

### 2. [Race Condition](https://techterms.com/definition/race_condition)
So basically, based on this site, race condition is a condition where a some processes access and manipulate the same data at the same time. It also being said that if a thread runs at an unexpected time, it can occurs a wrong input or a deadlock.

### 3. [Critical Section in Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/)
From this site, i learnt that critical section is a code segment that more than one processes access that code segment. The solution of critical section can be done by making a method that can lock process.

### 4. [Semaphores in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)
Based on this site, semaphores are integer variables that are used to solve the critical section problem by using two atomic operations, wait and signal for processing synchronization. There are two main types of semaphore, they are counting and binary semaphores. This site also provides explanation about the advantages and disadvantages of using semaphores.

### 5. [Introduction of Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)
In week 06, i already list this site and i decided to recall my memory about deadlocks so i revisit this site. This site has a picture to illustrate the explanation so i can recall my memory very easily.

### 6. [Deadlock Prevention And Avoidance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)
This site explains about how to prevent and avoid deadlock in operating system. This site also gives example on how the algorithm works. it is really good to help me understand about deadlock prevention algorithm.

### 7. [Banker’s Algorithm in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)
Banker's algorithm is one of deadlock prevention algorithm. It is done by simulating he allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. There is also an example provided in this site.

### 8. [Difference Between Deadlock and Starvation in OS](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os.html)
Deadlock and starvation might be pretty similar. This site shows the difference between them based on arising condition, resources, prevention, etc. This site done its job to show differences between both really good.

### 9. [Shared Memory](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/doc/html/interprocess/sharedmemorybetweenprocesses.html)
This site explains about shared memory and how shared memory are made and can be shared between processes. This site is really good because the explanation is pretty brief and it provides an explanation that really helps me to understand.

### 10. [Peterson’s Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)
Based on this site, Peterson's Algorithm is used for synchronizing two processes. I like this site a lot because it shows the code example and gives some clear explanation that really help me a lot.
