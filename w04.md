# Top 10 List of Week 04

### 1. [Data Types in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-types-in-c/)
I learnt about data types in C from this site, i can tell that theres no big differences in C's and Java's data types. The special thing is maybe the unsigned long long int in C, i never heard of them in Java. This site also provides information about the memory bites in each data types.

### 2. [Dynamic Memory Allocation in C using malloc(), calloc(), free() and realloc()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)
Array Size in C is changeable and dynamic in runtime. This is possible because theres a procedure in C called Dynamic Memory Allocation in C. Dynamic Memory Allocation can be done by some methods like malloc() calloc() etc.

### 3. [What is Endianness? Big-Endian vs Little-Endian Explained with Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-endianness-big-endian-vs-little-endian/)
Endianness simply is way of computer read bytes. Computer can read bytes from left-to-right either right-to-left. That's what big endian and little endian is.

### 4. [C Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)
Pointers is one of some things that makes C language different than other languages. With pointers, we can manage memory better than when we use other language.

### 5. [Format specifiers in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/format-specifiers-in-c)
Format specifiers is really useful for managing input and output. Formatting can help the program more simple. there are so many kind of format specifiers in C. This site provides a table that contain every format specifier and each type purposes.

### 6. [Lecture 3/12: Bits, Bytes and Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weyv-V8xz0c)
This video explains about difference between Bits, Bytes, and Words. The bit size is what makes them different. The lecturer in this video explains it very well.

### 7. [Address Binding and its Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/address-binding-and-its-types/)
When i read this week's slide, i find so many new terms for me, Address Binding is one of them. From this site, i learnt that address binding is the process of associating the program instruction and data to the actual physical memory locations.

### 8. [Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)
Paging is a memory management scheme to divide allocation of physical memory into blocks. I just knew about paging in operating system.

### 9. [Understanding Shared Libraries in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/)
There are two kind of library, static libraries and shared libraries. This website also explains about shared library naming conventions and other things like shared libraries management.

### 10. [Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Logical%20Address%20is%20generated%20by,also%20known%20as%20Virtual%20Address.&text=The%20hardware%20device%20called%20Memory,to%20its%20corresponding%20physical%20address.)
Logical address is generated while the program runs by CPU, logical address is virtual address (does not exist physically). Physical address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory.
