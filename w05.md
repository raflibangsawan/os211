# Top 10 List of Week 05

### 1. [Memory Management](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management)
When i searched for memory management's definition, i found this site. I learnt that, memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory. In the OS, memory management involves the allocations of spesific memory blocks.

### 2. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)
This page explains about what actually virtual memory is in operating system. Based on this site, virtual memory is a storage allocation scheme which secondary memory can be addressed as a part of main memory. I always pick geeksforgeeks site because it has the best interface in my opinion.

### 3. [What is Caching?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-caching)
I recall my memory about caching and i found this website. things that i can summarize from this site is: cache is a type of memory that is used to increase the speed of data access. It can increase the speed of data access because it doesnt requires any access to the main memory.

### 4. [Memory Allocation](https://binaryterms.com/static-and-dynamic-memory-allocation.html)
The act of assigning the memory address to the attribute of the variable is called memory allocation. There are some types of memory allocation, they are static and dynamics memory allocations. This site has done it job pretty well on explaining memory allocation in operating system.

### 5. [Thrashing in OS](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/thrashing-in-os)
This site has some people's opinion about trashing. It contains the definition of thrashing, what is the cause of thrashing and etc. This page also explains some fundamentals about thrashing like paging concept.

### 6. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)
Unlike the previous website that explains definition and other general things about thrashing, this site explain how to handle them. This site also provide some graphs to make the explanation more comprehensive.

### 7. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)
Page replacement is used for deciding which page needs to be replaced when page comes in. There are some page replacement, but FIFO (First In First Out) algorithm is the simplest one. I can comprehend the algorithm from this site very simply.

### 8. [Allocation of frames in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)
Based on this site, there are two commonly used algorithm that used for allocating frames, they are equal allocation and proportional allocation. There are also an advantage and a disadvantage on each algorithm.

### 9. [global vs local allocation in operating system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAZSOh77VT4)
This video explaind about the comparation between global and local allocation in operating system. This video is kinda easy to understand despite of the hindi accents that pretty hard to listen.

### 10. [Buddy System â€“ Memory allocation technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buddy-system-memory-allocation-technique/)
Buddy system is one of memory allocation technique. There are some advantages and disadvantages of this technique explained. This website also provides an example of how this technique works.
