# Top 10 List of Week 06

### 1. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)
Start from the basic, i searched what concurrency really is. Based from this page, concurrency is simply multi-tasking. Executing multiple instruction at the same time. There are some advantages and problems that can be occured from concurrency. This page explains it all very simply and briefly.

### 2. [Threads](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html)
Threads has a relations to concurrency, so i searched for it and found this website. This website explain some things about threads, and it also provides picture to illustrate every explanation. This site is really great despite of its not-so-user-friendly interface.

### 3. [Multithreading in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-operating-system/)
There are some tasks that cannot be done only by a single thread. Multithreading is the solution of that problem, with multithreading, two or more tasks can be executed simultaneously. This site has done its job to explain multithreading really well. This site also provides a sample of multithreading applications.

### 4. [Difference between Concurrency and Parallelism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism/)
There is one thing that looks similar with concurrency, it is parallelism. The difference between both thing is: concurrency is the task of running and managing the multiple computations at the same time meanwhile, parallelism is the task of running multiple computations simultaneously.

### 5. [Inter Process Communication (IPC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)
Processes can communicate with each other by shared memory or message passing. This site gives explanation how processes communicate with each way.

### 6. [fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)
fork() is used for creating a new process, which called child process. This site shows example what happen when fork is called.

### 7. [Threading Issues in OS](https://binaryterms.com/threading-issues-in-os.html)
There are some threading issues when it comes to multithreading like system calls, thread cancellation etc. This website explains each of them very well.

### 8. [Introduction to Deadlocks in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlocks)
Dreadlocks in OS are set of blocked processes that holds a resources and waiting to acquire a resource from other process. This site shows a picture that illustrate a flow of how dreadlock works in operating system context.

### 9. [System Calls for Process Control](https://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/330/Fork/fork.html)
Not only fork(), there are some other system calls in C like wait(), execl() etc. This website gives the explanation of what is the output from each system calls.

### 10. [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/)
Makefile are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. This website gives the example of how to do makefile and provides a tutorial video of makefile for beginners.
