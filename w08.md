# Top 10 List of Week 08

### 1. [Operating System - Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)
From this site, scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy. This site shows a diagram about the process scheduling which is really good.

### 2. [Operating System Scheduling algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)
There are some different kind of algorithm in process scheduling, such as: FCFS, SJN, RR, etc. This site provides explanation of each algorithm very briefly.

### 3. [FCFS Scheduling](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-fcfs-scheduling)
FCFS or first come first serve scheduling algorithm simply schedules the jobs according to their arrival time. There are some advantages of this algorithm, it is easy and simple. But there are also some disadvantages as well, and this site explained it all really well.

### 4. [Shortest Job First (SJF): Preemptive, Non-Preemptive Example](https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. There are two types of SJF methods, they are non-preemptive and preemptive. This site also gives explanation about characteristics of SJF Scheduling.

### 5. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)
This site explains about multiple processor scheduling. It explains pretty much everything about it such as Virtualization and Threading, Load Balancing, Multicore Processors etc.

### 6. [Priority Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)
Based on this site, priority scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. Same as SJF, There are two methods, they are non-preemptive and preemptive. This site also gives example of how priority scheduling algorithm work.

### 7. [Analysis of Algorithms | Big-O analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/)
I learned big-o analysis from algorithm and data structures course, and to recall my memory about it i tryna read about it again from this site. It has a really good explanation about it.

### 8. [Round Robin scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/)
Based on this site, Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. This site also gives a table of advantages and disadvantages of this algorithm. There is also an illustration given on this site. This site done its job really well on explaining about this algo.

### 9. [Difference Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-symmetric-and-asymmetric-multiprocessing.html)
This site explains the difference between symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing. It has a really great table of comparison between both.

### 10. [Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling: Key Differences](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)
I found out some algorithm in scheduling has 2 methods, preemptive and non-preemptive. I decided to searched for it, then found this site. This site shows a table to compare between both and it is really good way to show the difference between both.
